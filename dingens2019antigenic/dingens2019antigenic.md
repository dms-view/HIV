# Abstract 
Anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)
have revealed vaccine targets on the virus’s envelope (Env) protein and are themselves promising immunotherapies. The efficacy of bnAb-based therapies and vaccines depends in part on how readily
the virus can escape neutralization. Although structural studies can define contacts between bnAbs
and Env, only functional studies can define mutations
that confer escape. Here, we mapped how all
possible single amino acid mutations in Env affect
neutralization of HIV by nine bnAbs targeting five epitopes. For most bnAbs, mutations at only a small
fraction of structurally defined contact sites mediated escape, and most escape occurred at sites
near, but not in direct contact with, the antibody.
The Env mutations selected by two pooled bnAbs
were similar to those expected from the combination
of the bnAbs’s independent action. Overall, our mutation-level antigenic atlas provides a comprehensive dataset for understanding viral immune escape
and refining therapies and vaccines.
